# BB_prediction
A semi-automated labeling system with DL model assistance in product line condition

## main goal
Make a comparison between **absolute position prediction** and **moving vector prediction** by using object itself and frame difference

## function planning
- [x] Object extraction from dataset with certain classes and numbers
- [x] Image extension for sequential image set simulation
- [x] Frame difference data generation
- [ ] External input for absolute xy position (ground truth for position prediction)
- [x] Vector data generation (ground truth for vector prediction)
- [ ] Tranfer data from Tensor to DataLoader
- [ ] Deep learning model building
- [ ] Training / Testing function
- [ ] Quality validation function
- [ ] Visualization function
